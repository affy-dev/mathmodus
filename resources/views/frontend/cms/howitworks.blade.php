            <p>Data provided by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and the Annie E. Casey Foundation
                showed that 80% of students from low-income families and 60% of all other students have such serious
                reading deficiencies they cannot read. As a result, it is extremely difficult to get students to use
                textbooks for self-study or remedial purposes. The irony of this situation is that students who fail
                because they cannot read, are often placed in remedial programs where they are required to use the same
                textbooks that caused their previous failure. As a result, teachers often must create and deliver
                homework assignments using paper based work sheets. Although these work sheets can provide some support,
                they are not as effective as the repetitive practice and assessment that is provided by MathModus. </p>
            <p>Our solution eliminates the use of textbooks and replaces them with highly engaging video based lessons
                and pre-developed diagnostic assessment tests linked to targeted video based remedial lessons. The use
                of these automated features can now provide teachers and students with the tools needed by them to
                achieve math success. Simultaneously, teachers are provided with diagnostic reports that will reveal the
                math weaknesses of each student. Teachers use this information to conduct remedial discussions. During
                these sessions, teachers can instantly create and deliver diagnostic assessment tests to determine if
                students grasped the remedial information provided to them. These assessments can be repeated by each
                student until mastery is demonstrated by them.

                Although some may take issue with our use of video and the elimination of reading material from our
                instructional program, it is our belief we must find the most effective method to ensure that the math
                instruction provided to our students was learned by them. Based upon our use with many students there
                should be no reservations about the effectiveness of the combination of video, diagnostic assessment
                tests and teacher-led led remedial discussions using data supplied by MathModus.</p>

            <p>
                MathModus’ pre-developed assessment tests offer features never before available to teachers. For
                example, after a student views a video based lesson, they can initiate and take a new test by a single
                mouse “click”, however, teachers control this process by opening the test for them to take. MathModus
                will automatically erase prior scores and provide students with multiple opportunities to retest
                themselves. After a diagnostic assessment test is completed, it is graded, diagnosed in real-time, and
                generates a customized remedial course of study for each student based upon their test results. This
                course of study contains short, (six to 12 minutes in length) videos for each of the questions
                incorrectly answered. In addition, it also provides videos for foundation skills needed by students to
                fully grasp higher order math functions.

                One of its most important features is its ability to retain a historical record of every student’s
                results throughout their entire career in math. As a result, students will always have access and
                opportunities to retest themselves on earlier taught lessons and to receive remedial support for each of
                the lessons they have revisited. As each piece of information created by MathModus is instantly
                available in real-time, students can revisit this information as often as necessary. If they desire to
                retake an assessment test on any of this prior content, MathModus will deliver a customized remedial
                course of study based upon a student’s individual test results.

            <p>
                MathModus provides school administrators and teachers with an on-line EXECUTIVE INFORMATION SYSTEM that
                provides real-time academic reporting of every school, subject, teacher, and student in real-time. These
                reports will provide a school’s principal with more information in two minutes concerning their school’s
                academic health than that provided by all other methods. STATIS also provides principals with methods
                that will enhance their own leadership skills by helping teachers to improve their instructional
                performance. But most of all, it will enable them to help their students to improve their academic
                performance.
                Senior level administrators can receive real-time information that will enable them to evaluate the
                performance of every school, subject, teacher, and student across the entire school system. It will also
                provide incontrovertible evidence concerning each teacher’s and student’s instructional activities. As a
                result of the above, and its many other automated features, we are submitting our provisional patent
                application based upon Modus’ability to perform features never before possible. In the process of
                performing these tasks, it neither tells a teacher what, or how, to teach. It simply is a wonderful
                classroom support product that provides features and benefits that have never before been available for
                teachers, principals, and students to help them improve their own personal performance.
                MathModus does not tell a teacher what or how to teach, bur simply supports all of their classroom
                activities. As a result, teachers will never again have to return home each evening to create lesson
                plans, nor will they have to grade, diagnose , or create remedial activities for each of their student.
                As a result, they will enter and leave their classrooms each day secure in the knowledge that 100% of
                their students are being successfully monitored by the MODUS’ “intelligent” monitoring feature that will
                not allow a student to fail.
