            <!-- <p>Data provided by the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP)  and the Annie E. Casey Foundation showed that 80% of students from low-income families and 60% of all other students have such serious reading deficiencies they cannot read. As a result, it is extremely difficult to get students to use textbooks  for self-study or remedial purposes. The irony of this situation is that students who fail because they cannot read, are often placed in remedial programs where they are required to use the same textbooks that caused their previous failure.  As a result, teachers often must create and deliver homework assignments using paper based work sheets.  Although these work sheets can provide some support, they are not as effective as the repetitive practice and assessment that is provided by MathModus. </p> -->
