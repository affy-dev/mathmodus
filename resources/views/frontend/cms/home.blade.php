            <p style="font-size:14px">MathModus is an on-line, easy-to-use blended learning system for use in
                Mathematics subjects from grades 4 through Calculus. Through its use of computer based automation,
                MathModus delivers pre-developed instructional lessons, diagnostic assessment tests, and targeted
                remedial instruction. As a result, teachers will not be required to return home each evening to create
                lessons, tests, or to grade and diagnose student outcomes. Through MathModus’ use, teachers will always
                be aware of what is required of them to ensure subject matter mastery by their students. Simultaneously,
                students will have the capability to assume their own responsibility for subject matter mastery through
                independent self-paced study targeted to their needs by MathModus.
                Through automation, teachers can increase their diagnostic testing activities with the assurance that
                MathModus will not only diagnose a student’s problem, but will deliver a customized course of remedial
                study to each student based upon their test results. In addition, it also provides teachers with
                real-time diagnostic data that enables them to hold targeted remedial discussions with students in need
                of this critical assistance. Upon completion of these “face-to-face” discussions with their teacher,
                students can then use MathModus’ repetitive diagnostic assessment and remediation strategies as often as
                necessary to achieve mastery. Throughout this entire repetitive process, teachers are made aware of each
                student’s progress and use this real-time data to assist in the remedial process.

                Through its use of easy-to-use, intuitive commands, a teacher’s can orchestrate a classroom based
                instructional program where each student is working on their individual needs either with the teacher or
                during independent study. Students are provided with automated capabilities that will enable them to use
                Adaptive, Differentiated, or Prescriptive instructional methods customized by MathModus to their exact
                needs. Because of these self-directed learning strategies, teachers are freed to hold remedial
                discussions with other students. During these teacher led group discussions, teachers use the diagnostic
                data provided by MathModus to deliver instruction that is of importance to each student. When a student
                obtains the remedial instruction needed by them, they can go on-line to test themselves on the areas
                corrected by their teacher. At anytime during the school year, a student can review and retest
                themselves on any section of the curriculum in which they had problems. As multiple test types are
                always available to them , they can retest on a single lesson, a unit of instruction, midterm or final
                exam as often as they feel necessary to prepare for EOY tests. MathModus “intelligent” oversight feature
                will continuously monitor their performance and alert them when it senses help is needed.
                Through its many features and functions, MathModus guarantees that every student will achieve success in
                math because its diagnostic capabilities identify and provide corrective instruction when it occurs.
                Because a student’s success is based on skills taught in earlier math subjects, MathModus delivers
                remediation for those foundation skills lessons they may have failed to master from prior year math
                subjects.
                During its use in the classroom, MathModus neither tells a teacher how, or what , to teach. It simply
                supports every aspect of their instruction, assessment, diagnostics, remedial, and reporting needs that
                will make them far more effective, while substantially reducing their daily level of effort.

            </div>
            <p style="font-size:14px">Modus is an LLC corporation established in Virginia owned and operated by retired
                educators and educational technologists who, collectively, possess more than 100 years of teaching and
                educational technology experience. Since 1997, we have installed our proprietary on-line educational
                products in more than 1,700 schools who placed 1.2 million students in its curriculum for credit
                recovery and graduation purposes.
                During this period, some of our nation’s most prestigious educational institutions and research
                organizations expressed their concern about the educational effectiveness of on-line Learning Management
                Systems (LMS). Studies conducted by four of these organizations identified six major reasons why they
                believed these products do not provide the quality educational experience predicted by their developers
                when use as the sole source of a student’s education. The six reasons are:
                1. Reading difficulties of students
                2. Student’s inability to comprehend what they have read
                3. Lack of Mathematics foundation skills
                4. Lack of real-time diagnostic assessment tools
                5. Lack of remedial methods and tools
                6. Inability of students to obtain targeted remedial instruction
                During the past five years, we have spent countless hours in researching the needs of teachers and
                students to resolve the above issues, and the many others brought to our attention by our clients.
                Through our use of automation, our proprietary product, MathModus©, will decrease a teacher’s daily
                workload by as much as 60% during their delivery of instruction, assessment, diagnostics, and
                remediation. More Importantly, through automation, it substantially increases a student’s ability to
                achieve mastery in Mathematics through “intelligent “ oversight that can reveal and remediate the “gaps”
                in each student’s math education, even for subjects taught as long ago as three or four years! To date,
                more than 100,000 students have successfully used its automated features to achieve success in
                Mathematics even when all previously used remedial had failed. Not a single student or teacher has ever
                found fault with its ability to find and correct their problems in math.
